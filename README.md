# Overview
## About
To complete this project I used the following languages/software:
- JavaScript
- html
- css
- vs code Version: 1.57.1

Data Source: UFO data (data.js)


## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criterias such as Date, cityname, country, and shape at the same time. Using JavaScript and HTML, I modified the code in my index.html file to create more table filters.
## Results: 
**When you first open the link to the webpage you will see the page that looks like this:**

**Let's filter the page to see the UFO sightings for the state Oregon. To do that you simply have to type or on "Enter a State" filtering box and you will get the result of UFO sightings for that state. But remember you have type in lowercase only.**

**Similarly If you want to filter the city you can just type the name of the city on "Enter a City" filtering box. For the shape type shape on "Enter a Shape" box. For date type the date in m/d/y format on "Enter a Date" box.**

## Summary: 
#### The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage.
The one drawback is that you have to type in lowercase. If you type in Uppercase letter while filtering out desired results you will not get any results.

#### The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development.
- It would be really helpful to look at UFO sightings if we can add maps showing UFO Sightings all over the world. 
- The another thing I would like to add is the website(if we can access/exists) that constantly updates the UFO sightings, so that we can see if any new sighting is spotted.
